# Final Year Project: Sentisights

#### By Vanshika Sinha

## About the Project

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Google Play Store reviews dataset for analysing customer reviews to help companies, businesses and app developers gain useful insights through their customer's feedbacks using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The research focuses on obtaining and analysing textual data from reviews and classifying them into various classes such as positive, negative or neutral based on the user's mood. The dataset for this research was gathered from Google Play Store reviews, which include a significant number of consumer reviews.

The project starts with exploratory data analysis, which includes data cleaning and pre-processing the data. Pre-processed data is then used to train and test several machine learning and deep learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and BERT. The models' performance is compared using several classification measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The study also investigates the effect of hyperparameter tuning on model performance, and the most optimal hyperparameters are determined. Furthermore, the study investigates the interpretability, scalability, computational power, training duration, data volume and diversity of the various models.

## Results achieved

The project findings show that the BERT model still outperforms the other models in terms of classification accuracy and F1-score, although the other machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes also showcase a good accuracy. However, the model's training time and computational power needs are much higher than those of the other models, and hence according to the specific objectives and goals, one may want to rethink their idea of selection of a model and may want to consider some other factors such as resource requirements, training time and data volume and diversity to meet their particular needs. The study finishes with recommendations for future work, such as increasing the model's interpretability and scalability and expanding the analysis to other datasets
